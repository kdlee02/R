# Linear Statistical Models using R

Overview
The docx focuses on applying statistical modeling techniques where key tasks include linear regression, principal component analysis, ridge regression, logistic regression, and possion regression.

Task 1: Longley Dataset Analysis

Fit and evaluate standardized linear regression models.

Compare regression coefficients between original and standardized models.

Analyze multicollinearity using correlation matrices and scatterplots.

Apply principal component analysis to identify collinear variable sets.

Estimate regression coefficients using PCA and ridge regression.


Task 2: Field Goal Kicking Data Analysis

Fit logistic regression models to predict field goal success rates based on distance.

Extend models to include league-specific effects using indicator variables.

Evaluate the contribution of higher-order terms and league-specific differences.


Task 3: Airline Accident Data Analysis

Compare ordinary least squares (OLS) and Poisson regression for modeling accident counts to asses which method better explains the data.
